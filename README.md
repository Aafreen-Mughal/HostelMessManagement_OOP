A comprehensive management system created to simplify and automate the hostel mess operations. It was created primarily to make managing the hostel's mess facility's daily tasksâ€”such as ordering food, creating menus, keeping track of inventory, charging customers, and giving feedback. In addition, there is a mood determination class which determines the mood of the customers and there are two kinds of customer in this project one is students and another is faculty/staff. There is 20% discount for the faculty customers and no discount for the students.
